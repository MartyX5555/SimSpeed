# What's this?
*If the lag cannot be solved in simple terms, what if the whole game is slowed down?*

The SimSpeed is a performance system based on adjusting the whole game speed to compensate the lag, likely caused by collisions or massive amount of moving props, effectively increasing the performance during said cases. This system is highly inspired by VRAGE engine Sim Speed, that powers games like Space Engineers.
